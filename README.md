# planetsentangled

*planetsentangled* was forked from *flatlib*, a python library for Traditional Astrology by Jo√£o Ventura.

## Documentation

Not yet available.

## Installation

*planetsentangled*, as a recent fork (Feb. 2021) from *flatlib*, is still under basic development, thus with no recipe for proper installation. I intend to add graphic functionality by using *plotly* to follow general planetary aspects on a long time range (decades or centuries).
